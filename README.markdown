I'm a [free/libre open source][1] advocate that has a strong interest in researching how to make non-feudal computing
systems for the general public. I post at least once a week to my [personal website][2], occassionally [livestream][3]
from my home lab and am usually talking about the intersections of technology, humanity and politics on my social
networking accounts.

As a F/LOSS advocate, you'll find my recent projects on [sourcehut][5]; a libre platform for developers to work on code.
