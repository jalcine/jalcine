# Hello, I'm [jalcin√©](https://jacky.wtf).
<img align="right" src="https://jacky.wtf/assets/favicon.2fb16a8e.svg" style="float: right; display: inline-block;" />

I'm a [free/libre open source][1] advocate that has a strong interest in researching how to make non-feudal computing
systems for the general public. I post to my [personal website][2], talking about the intersections of technology, humanity and the like.

As a F/LOSS advocate, you'll find my recent projects on [sourcehut][5]; a libre platform for developers to work on code. Any work and/or contributions on this platform are *largely* done without willingness &mdash; a side effect of [chokepoint capitalism](https://chokepointcapitalism.com/) deployed by a corporate attempt [of a commons theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).

> GitHub and its parent company, Microsoft, both [willingly support and defend their business relations with the
> inhumane facets of the US federal government][4] despite championing themselves as a community center and a bastion of
> the open community.
